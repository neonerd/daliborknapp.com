When you sit on high seat you become a viewer. To be an animal
means to be observed — from birth till death and even after
death — on a plate — the animal can’t escape from others
attention. A film about the animal which refused to be an
animal. A Film which refused to be a film. Nevertheless, viewer
can see them. Both of them. This installation was a part of
residency program High seats, hunters and animal paths in
Kravín Rural Arts, Hranice u Malče, Vysočina, Czech Republic.
