The exposure time is the present. A video essay on horror,
spaghetti, and the pyramid used to guide a plane. And also
about other things. A study of a world where a direction of
light is changed. The film is another attempt at offering
testimony. Everything definitive evokes ridicule. The previous
sentence is proof, as is this one. And this one.

Only for cinema.
