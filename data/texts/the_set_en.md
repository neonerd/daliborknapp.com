It really does not matter if The Set is a main film or its
own making of. The set is a film about a film – formally and
thematically. The narrative is a motion from point A to point B
– it is meant in a physical and in a linguistic sense as well.
Inception, continuation, destruction over and over.

Only for cinema.
