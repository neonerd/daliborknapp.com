A universal and neverending story about Great future and about
universal mechanism which is used against the Great future.
Mine. Yours. Ours. The text in the loop is a dialogue at the
same time. Technology is presenting the story, but technology
itself is out of presence. New technology brings the future,
the old one refers to the past.
