This is a cinema for two viewers. There’s no moving image,
only the moving viewers. From the past to the future. The
viewers are in different points in time. The first one is
a future version of the second, the second one is a past
version of the first. Face to face, they are both heading
to the future. The situation of viewers’ bodies relates to
the video. Body as a foundation stone of society. Physical
experience as a condition of solidarity. This video explores
relationships between body, future, language, image,
perspective, solidarity and violence. For a better world more
violence is needed. Far more.
